# ARP Spoof Detector 

This Python tool detects **ARP spoofing / ARP poisoning** attacks in real time.  
It works by sniffing ARP packets on the network and comparing the actual MAC address of a host with the one announced in ARP replies. If they do not match, it warns you that you may be under attack.
